# Grocery-Shopping-Recommendation-System
Food shoppers especially vegetarians who have fewer food sources available to a attain
the nutrients they need to have a healthy life, constantly look for food sources with
higher nutritional value; However, the price of a food item also plays an important
role in buyerâ€™s decision due to the limited budget and high price of vegetables in most
parts of the world.In this paper, to optimize the shopping decision, a 0/1 knapsack
problem is formulated and a comparison of the traditional recursive solution method
and the dynamic programming optimization approach is made. The results show that
the dynamic programming method outperforms the recursive solution method in terms
of computational time for large number of purchase items.
